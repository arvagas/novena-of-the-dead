    <h2 class='home-header'>What is a Novena?</h2>
    <p class='text-content'>A novena, in Roman Catholicism, is a successive, nine-day period of prayer, typically performed for special occasions or requesting special favors from God.</p>

    <h2 class='home-header'>Why pray for the dead?</h2>
    <p class='text-content'>In Roman Catholicism, it is a way to ask God to accept those who died into heaven. We pray because we want God to forgive the person from any wrongdoings he/she/they may have done while alive, and grant them entrance into paradise.</p>

    <h2 class='home-header'>What does this site do differently from the rest?</h2>
    <p class='text-content'>The great thing about this site is that it's responsive. One of the goals I had when planning this site was to make it fully responsive, meaning that wherever it's viewed, it looks good. From computer screens to phones, the website will adapt to the display it is in.</p>
