# Novena Prayer of the Dead

Coming from a Filipino, Catholic household, it's not unusual that I attend novenas (special prayers on nine successive days), particularly ones in honor of the dead. I've recently attended two of the nine days, and each one had a different structure of prayer formats. I decided to look online afterwards just to see if there is an actual structure.. and to my surprise there was none! Some were formatted long, while others were short.

**This project has two main goals:**

1. Recreate the format of a long structure, then make an abridged version of it. Check.

I did a bit of research, and I didn't really see any responsive sites/apps that were related to this project so..

2. Make a responsive site that fits on all screens (save the trees!)
