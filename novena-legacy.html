But I beg this grace especially through that bleeding Heart of Thy Blessed Mother when She wrapped and clothed Thy Sacred Body for burial and accompanied It to the Sepulchre. Reduce those who are in sin to a true repentance of them and grant me what I ask in this novena for Thy greater honor and glory. Amen.</p>
