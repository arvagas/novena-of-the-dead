            <p>Most powerful and merciful Lord Jesus, lover of souls, most admirable in Thy saints; listen to the sighs and pleas of the souls in Purgatory who are desirous of Thy mercy and to the prayers of those who are making this novena for them, so that they may obtain Thy mercy and deign to rescue them from that prison of their great suffering. I beseech Thee to relieve first those who are suffering there through my fault, my close relatives, the abandoned, and those who are about to be released from Purgatory. I beseech Thee also, to free above all, those who injured me most and deliver from their sins those who are in the bondage of mortal sin and bring them to a sincere repentance of their sins, and become worthy of Heaven. Amen.</p>
